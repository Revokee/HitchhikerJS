# HitchhikerJS

Building project needs npm and node. If you don't have it installed, it's recommended to use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). On Windows, use the node installer from [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After you got all installed, simply run:

```
npm install
grunt
```

It should compile all your typescript files and concat it into a debug file on 

```
build/hitchhiker.js
```
